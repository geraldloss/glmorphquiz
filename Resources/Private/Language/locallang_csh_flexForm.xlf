				<source><![CDATA[If you like to create your own layout for the morphing quiz, then copy the file MorphQuiz.css from the folder /typo3conf/ext/glmorphquiz/Resources/Public/css/ in any place under /fileadmin/ and customize it for your own needs. Never alter the name of the classes. Only the content of the classes is allowed for changings. 
      									Then describe the path to this file from the fileadmin-folder in this field. For instance if you have place your own css file in the folder /fileadmin/myHomepage/myownMorphQuiz.css then you have to write myHomepage/myownMorphQuiz.css into this field. If you leave it empty, then this plugin use the default css file. Should you try to set more then one morphing quiz on one page, then you need to place in every quiz the same alternate CSS file. Otherwise would win alway the css file of the last quiz.]]>
